# LiveFrameworks — product direction

Read this before changing UX, copy, or first-run flow.
This is the shared reasoning behind the `dev/first-run` work (PR #1) and the next slices.
Do not treat production (`https://liveframeworks.vercel.app`) as this direction until this branch is merged.

**Branch:** `dev/first-run` · **PR:** https://github.com/mattrob333/Liveframeworks/pull/1  
**Do not push to `main` unless Matthew says so.**

## The core problem

LiveFrameworks was a **tool dressed as a product**.

The landing sold: paste a URL, get a strategy team for the price of a coffee.
The app delivered: open the pipeline, bring an Anthropic key, chat until the Cartographer is `[SATISFIED]`, then unlock 16 handbook chapters.

Those are different jobs. The first is a product. The second is a live companion to *The Strategist's Framework Handbook*.

We are turning the first-run into a product without throwing away the tool. The pipeline stays. It is no longer the front door.

---

## Who it is for

**B2B. Advisors and consultants** (and strategy-fluent operators) running an engagement. Often screenshared with a founder or CEO.

Not a generic SMB owner. Not a B2C consumer app. The coffee line is a price joke, not a buyer.

Intake copy already knew this (your contact, client interview, leadership template). Design and first-run should know it too.

## What we changed on this branch (PR #1)

### First-run is the product

1. Home primary action is **company URL + one paragraph**, then Draw.
2. That auto-draws the Business Model Canvas. Chat **argues with the map**. It does not gate seeing it. No `[SATISFIED]` wall before the nine-box.
3. The 16-agent roster is **hidden on first-run home**.
4. **Pipeline is the expert view.** Intake buckets, spine, export, settings, framework pages, and the `lf:*` localStorage model stay. Do not break them.

Completing the handbook is a course. Shipping a canvas (and later a brief) they can take to Monday is a product.

Theory of Constraints is the real punchline ("the one thing that matters"). It stays **later**, not first-run. Do not add agents.

### QA / first-run integrity (also on this branch)

These were product bugs, not polish:

1. Empty API key must not save as success.
2. Empty intake must not save as success. Business bucket requires URL + description.
3. BMC must not be READY/ENABLED when the required bucket is empty.
4. Research / Draw must be disabled with no key. Do not error after click.
5. Selection lives in the URL (`/pipeline?select=bmc`). `/?select=*` redirects there. Unknown slugs say unknown.
6. Themed 404, not the default white Next page.
7. Mobile nav tap targets at least 44px.

## Locked UX (now on this branch)

1. **In-place key.** Hide the key field until URL + paragraph are valid. Then reveal a password input above Draw. Same primary button. Helper: “Key stays in this browser.” Settings keeps Remove / Reset. **Eating the first canvas (we pay for inference) is out.**
2. **Canvas is home after first run.** Once a complete BMC exists, `/` is that canvas (same workspace as `/framework/bmc`). Intake is a quiet “New company,” not the home form.
3. **Nav.** Brand is the company hostname from the URL, linking `/`. Pipeline and Export stay. **New company** appears only after a canvas exists (and on `/?new=1` / Pipeline when a company is loaded). No second workspace toolbar. No “API Key” label. A small status dot means key present. The key itself lives in Settings (and the in-place field on first run).
4. **● LIVE** only while a request is in flight. Idle: no indicator. No key: no LIVE; the composer says a key is needed. Never fake live.
5. **Filled canvas is a brief.** After an artifact exists, the page is the map + chat. One title: the company, then the map. Land on the map only — do not pre-open a cell. Click a region for a single inspector (what’s in the box, sources, Discuss). Gaps / assumptions / next questions tuck into that inspector, not a second card deck. Pipeline keeps the handbook chrome (roster, tool calls, unlock graph). The nine-box stays a nine-box on desktop; phones may stack.
6. **One next move.** After a filled framework, one quiet line and one button under the map (after BMC: “Next: Industry Map” → `/pipeline?select=industrymap`). RACI’s next move is “Open Export.” No roster, no locked rows, no wake counts on the canvas.
7. **Chat rail is the agent.** Icon + role name + one voice sentence. A chevron “How this was built” goes to Pipeline. No Update button. Chat still cannot write the locked artifact.
8. **Two exports, two files.** `/export` preview **is** the client brief: company, date, optional intake paragraph as the lede, then only completed frameworks. If BMC is the only lock, that is the whole brief — do not leave empty slots for the other 15. No digest overflow, no empty-cell placeholders, no “LiveFrameworks engagement.” stub. BMC stays a nine-box on screen and on paper (export print is landscape so the ten-column grid has width). Coverage, nav, the two buttons, and the site footer are screen-only (`@media print` hides them). **Print brief** is the primary action (`window.print()` — not a Download PDF button). **Download for an agent** is the secondary consultant tool: flattened `.md` (headings + bullets, no JSON dump). The `.md` never becomes the preview. Do not put gaps, assumptions, or the 16-agent roster on the brief.

## Visual direction (now on this branch)

**Light is the default.** Dark tokens stay unused for a later operator toggle.

Keep the field-manual identity on paper:
- IBM Plex Mono
- square corners
- amber
- 1px rules
- quiet grid

**Invert the paper. Do not invent a new look.** Not generic SaaS gray.
The working surface (landing, canvas, pipeline, settings, export, 404, nav) matches a printed brief.

On a filled framework: body 14px, chrome / labels 12px minimum, dim ink no lighter than about `#5A5548`. Labels are ink, not faint orange-on-cream.

---

## What is still a tool (on purpose, for now)

- BYO Anthropic key in `localStorage`. No accounts, no database.
- No shareable link, no hosted engagement.

**Persistence + a shareable brief is the product line.** Not more agents. That is the milestone after this UX slice.

---

## What not to do

- Do not put the 16-agent roster back on first-run home.
- Do not make Pipeline the landing CTA again.
- Do not reintroduce a chat-satisfaction gate before the canvas is visible.
- Do not add frameworks or agents to make it feel more complete.
- Do not merge to `main` or overwrite production as part of exploratory work.
- Do not clone this repo onto a local agent machine unless Matthew explicitly asks.

## How to tell you got it

A new user pastes a company URL and a paragraph, draws a canvas, and has something they could put on a call. The handbook is still there, one click into Pipeline, for the consultant who wants the full engagement.
